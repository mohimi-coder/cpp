## CPP Modules - 42 School

This repository marks the beginning of my journey into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), following an intensive year dedicated to mastering C programming. 
It contains all the modules from the C++ Piscine at 42 School, organized into individual folders. Each folder includes the corresponding exercises and a PDF with detailed instructions.

## Module Overview:

  ✔️ Module 00: Introduction to namespaces, classes, member functions, standard I/O streams, initialization lists,   
      static and const keywords, and other foundational concepts.
  
  ✔️ Module 01: Focus on memory allocation, references, pointers to members, and file streams.
  
  ✔️ Module 02: Exploration of ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading, and canonical class structures.
  
  ✔️ Module 03: Deep dive into inheritance.
  
  ✔️ Module 04: Understanding subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, and interfaces.
